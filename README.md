# Enabling Intelligent Process Automation: First Results of a Student Project

**Abstract**: This paper explores how a leading technology company perceives and navigates the
challenges of AI governance in the context of IPA. Drawing on qualitative data from expert interviews,
it reveals tensions between ethical aspirations, regulatory demands, and practical implementation.
Key findings highlight the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration, adaptive governance, and
ethical maturity in addressing emerging compliance frameworks such as the EU AI Act. The study
offers early empirical insights into how governance dynamics shape IPA development within enabling
organizations.
